# ðŸ›’ CWR Shop â€“ E-Commerce Website (Frontend)

**CWR Shop** is a simple and user-friendly e-commerce frontend project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It is designed to showcase a wide range of products in a clean and responsive layout, with features like dark mode, search functionality, and mobile-friendly design.

This project simulates an online shopping interface and serves as a beginner-friendly layout for learning front-end development. It includes visual product cards, basic interactivity, and a modern UI without using any frameworks or libraries.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The main idea behind this project is to build a static e-commerce website that presents different categories of products such as electronics, fashion, home decor, and more. Each product is displayed with an image, name, price, description, and a basic "Add to Cart" button for UI purposes (functionality not implemented).

All the features are built using core web technologies to help understand layout creation, styling, and simple interactivity from scratch.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Responsive Design**  
  Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

- **Product Grid**  
  Multiple product cards are neatly displayed using CSS Flexbox for a clean layout.

- **Search Filter**  
  A real-time search bar allows users to filter products by name using JavaScript.

- **Dark Mode**  
  A toggle button lets users switch between light and dark themes for better readability.

- **Image Slider**  
  A top section with sliding banner images that adds a modern touch.

- **Hamburger Menu**  
  Mobile users get a collapsible menu with navigation links.

- **Footer Section**  
  Includes basic company info and social media icons styled with Ionicons.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **HTML** â€“ Used for the structure and layout of the site.
- **CSS** â€“ For styling, positioning, color themes, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** â€“ Adds functionality like dark mode, menu toggle, and product filtering.
- **Ionicons** â€“ Used for icons in the menu and footer.

- Designing user-friendly interfaces with smooth hover effects
- Structuring code for small frontend projects

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements
